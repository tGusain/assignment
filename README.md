The Code is divided in two 3 modules
1. Utility : all the utility function will be there is the utility file. e.g getDistance and getTime.
2. Algorithms : all the alogrithms will be added into algorithm section e.g firstMile, waitingTime, delayTime etc.
3. FormulateResult : The function/module will formulate the result.
4. Main Module (Delivery) : This is basically the handler function. It handles order of algorithm, providing THRESHOLDS, formulating result etc.
5.
